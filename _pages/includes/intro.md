I am a PhD candidate at [the College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) (浙江大学计算机学院).

I work on the Audio Research Team at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhou Zhao (赵洲)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou).
Previously, I graduated from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/main.htm), Zhejiang University (浙江大学竺可桢学院), with dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Automation. 
I have also served as a visiting scholar at [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) with [Prof. Zhiyao Duan](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/people/faculty/duan_zhiyao) and [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) with [Prof. Przemyslaw Grabowicz](https://www.cics.umass.edu/about/directory/przemyslaw-grabowicz).

My research interests primarily focus on **Multi-Modal Generative AI**, specifically in **Spatial Audio, Music, and Singing Voice**. I have published first-author papers at top international AI conferences, including NeurIPS, AAAI, and EMNLP. Currently, I am working on **spatial audio generation (binaural or FOA speech/audio/music) with multimodal prompts**. 

**I am actively seeking research collaborations. Please feel free to contact me via email at yuzhang34@zju.edu.cn.**
